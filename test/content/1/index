<h2>Welcome to micro</h2>
<p>"Micro" is a simple static site generator that is written in shell programming language. It has a long way upon its face to become a good and complete site generator but I thank you because of your choice. I will be glad if you tell me my script problems and bugs and give me your suggestions about "micro". It is my first serious script in bash and I thank you again for your ideas that give to me.</p>
<p>You can download my script from github. <a href="https://github.com/moheb2000/micro">Just click here</a></p>
