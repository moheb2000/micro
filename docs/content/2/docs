<p>After that copy this file in /home/bin directory. If it does not exist create it. Then open bash and enter in a directory that you want to design and develop your site. use this command:</p>
<code>cd my-site-directory</code>
<p>Then write and run this command:</p>
<code>micro</code>
<p>In the first step, the script wants you to enter your site title. In the next step, you should enter your site-building directory. If you do not enter a directory it is create your site in frontend directory by default. Wish your site function and select a directory (this directory must exist).</p>
<code>Please enter your site title -> <br />Please enter build address(If you are not sure just click enter) -> </code>
<h3>Apache2</h3>

<code>/var/www/html</code>
